**Title:** Socratic Mode: AI-Powered Developer Coaching for Real Learning

**Overview:** Socratic Mode is a new interaction paradigm for AI coding assistants that prioritizes *learning through doing*. Instead of delivering instant code completions, the assistant guides the user step-by-step through the thinking process, prompting them to attempt implementation before revealing a solution. The assistant then provides a side-by-side comparison, critique, and reflective discussion.

This model bridges the gap between productivity and pedagogy, turning AI into a **coach**, not a crutch. It’s designed for onboarding juniors, upskilling mid-levels, and supporting seniors with complex architectural decisions.

---

**ChatGPT-Based Interaction Flow (Test-Driven UX Concept):** This is how a session would unfold in ChatGPT using Socratic Mode, with TDD (Test-Driven Development) principles applied:

1. **User Prompt (Intent-Driven Onboarding):**

   > "Write a Python Flask API with a /ping route that returns 'pong'."

2. **AI Pauses and Probes for Direction:**

   > "Before we jump into the code, let’s set your direction."
   >
   > - What’s your current skill level with APIs or Flask?
   > - Do you want to explore a framework like Flask, or build something more custom?
   > - Should we structure this as a one-off lesson, or start a workspace for tracking your progress?
   > - Would you like to eventually connect your local editor so I can help with diffs and reviews?

3. **User Selects Guided Mode (TDD Example):**

   > AI proceeds with: "Alright, let's learn this the test-driven way."
   >
   > - What should the test assert?
   > - What status code and content should `/ping` return?
   > - Should the response format be JSON? You'll also need a way to simulate requests—use a `client` fixture to do that. Try writing the test and fixture (Red Phase)."

4. **User Pastes Red Test Case:**

```python
import pytest
from flask import Flask

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route("/ping")
    def ping():
        return "pong"

    with app.test_client() as client:
        yield client

class TestPingEndpoint:
    def test_ping(self, client):
        response = client.get("/ping")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json == {"message": "pong"}
```

5. **AI Prompts for Minimal Implementation (Green Phase):**

   > "Great! Now let’s write just enough code to make that test pass. Paste your implementation when ready."

6. **User Pastes Code:**

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/ping")
def ping():
    return "pong"
```

7. **AI Returns Ideal Code + Git-Style Diff Commentary (Refactor Phase):**

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/ping", methods=["GET"])
def ping():
    return jsonify({"message": "pong"})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

#### Comparison Table

| **Your Code**       | **AI Version**                                 | **Explanation**                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| return "pong"       | return jsonify({"message": "pong"})            | ❗ *Test will fail without JSON.* ✅ `jsonify()` satisfies the structure expected by the test.              |
| @app.route("/ping") | @app.route("/ping", methods=["GET"])           | ❗ *Route may respond to unintended methods.* ✅ Restricting methods ensures RESTful accuracy and security. |
| *(none)*            | if **name** == "**main**": app.run(debug=True) | ❗ *Missing entry point for manual testing.* ✅ Enables dev mode execution and debugging.                   |

8. **Reflection and Extension Prompt:**
   > "Awesome! Want to add another test? Try `/echo/<text>` and write a test for it first."

This format maps perfectly to Red-Green-Refactor and reinforces test-driven habits from day one — now improved with **intent-aware guidance**.

---

**Target Users:**

- Junior developers in training
- Bootcamp students
- Mid-level devs onboarding to new stacks
- Engineering orgs doing in-house upskilling

---

**Key Features:**

- AI “waits” for user code before responding
- Encourages test-first workflows (Red → Green → Refactor)
- Auto-generated diffs between user and ideal solution
- Embedded links to official documentation or StackOverflow
- Personal progress tracking (when memory is enabled)
- Adjustable AI strictness (coaching vs. rescuing)
- **Intent-gathering onboarding questions to adapt coaching style**
- **Future: Editor extensions for real-time diffs and local code sync**

---

**Tech Stack Suggestion:**

- Frontend: React / Svelte for interactive coding interface
- Backend: FastAPI + OpenAI API
- AI Layer: GPT-4 (with system prompt tuned for Socratic behavior)
- Diff engine: Monaco Editor diff, Git-style annotations
- Persistent memory: Supabase / Redis / Postgres

---

**Business Model:**

- **B2B SaaS:** AI coaching tools for dev teams (\$/seat)
- **Bootcamp licenses:** per-student pricing with LMS integration
- **Enterprise onboarding:** white-label version for internal training platforms
- **Freemium tier:** community version for hobbyists

---

**Next Steps:**

1. Build MVP with intent-aware onboarding and Red-Green-Refactor flow
2. Pilot with a bootcamp or open-source dev community
3. Approach OpenAI, Replit, or GitHub for partnership
