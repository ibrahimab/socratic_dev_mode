# Socratic Dev Mode

## Overview

Socratic Dev Mode is a novel AI-powered programming assistant interaction paradigm that focuses on teaching by guiding. Instead of delivering code directly, the AI prompts users to reason, attempt solutions, and compare their attempts to best practices—mimicking real mentorship.

## Core Workflow

1. Step-by-step breakdown of a programming task
2. Prompt user to write their own implementation
3. AI generates a reference implementation
4. Side-by-side diff and critique
5. Optional challenges to deepen learning

## Origin

This idea was first proposed by a ChatGPT user ("nah") on July 12, 2025, during a live design session. The user emphasized learning-by-doing, scaffolding cognitive growth, and slowing down AI responses to build intuition rather than dependency.
